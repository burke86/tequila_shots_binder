Experimental: Analyze TEQUILA SHOTS output using Binder!

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/burke86/tequila_shots_binder/master?filepath=tequila.ipynb)

This repository contains the code to read TEQUILA SHOTS pipeline output and analyze the result with Lightkurve. Re-running the pipeline or running new objects is not supported.

Example output for NGC 4395 from [Burke et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200504491B/abstract) is included at 1/10th cadence.
