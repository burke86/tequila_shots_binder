Analyze TEQUILA SHOTS output using Binder!

This **experimental** repository contains the code to read TEQUILA SHOTS pipeline output and analyze the result with Lightkurve. Re-running the pipeline or running new objects is not supported.

Example output for NGC 4395 from [Burke et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200504491B/abstract) is included at 1/10th cadence.
